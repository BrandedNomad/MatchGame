## Motivation

I wanted to code something in plain vanilla javascript

## Tech/Framework Used

Build with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Features

* Flip tiles
* Fun way to pass the time

## Installation

1.Fork and clone: 

`git clone https://github.com/BrandedNomad/MatchGame.git`

2.Open index.html in the browser.

## How To Use It

Find each tiles matching number by:
1. Clicking on a tile to flip it over
2. Clicking on another tile to see if it is a match.
3. If it's a match, the tiles will stay flipped. If not they will turn back over. 

You win when you have found all the matching pairs.

to restart the game, simply refresh the browser tab.
